<h1> Exercise 3 </h1>

<p> (<strong>Artist Sketch</strong>) Exercise 3: Dogs in Space. Two space pups exploring outer space with the amousious deathstar and starry night.<br>

  <br>Functions: <br>
  - push & pop: For ltSpacePup and ltSpacePup2 <br>
  - parent & child: Added space helmets, color variety, backpacks, caps, and sunglasses <br>
  - bounce: ltSpacePup moves side to side on the screen looking like a superhero <br>
  - wraparound: Makes ltSpacePup2 drop down from the screen <br>
  - wrapper/keypressed: this moves with space ship with the mouseX and mouseY. Uses r for rotating, t for scaling down,s for scaling up,m is for <br>
    translating on the x-axis, and n is for translating on the y-axis.<br>
  - if statements/counters: to test my bounce and wraparound functions <br>
  - rotation: my deathstar is rotation and moving with my space dogs<br>
  - random: to create my starry and stationary stars<br>

  <br>Struggles: <br>
  - Adding keypressed and the wrapper, kept breaking my function, I found this rather difficult and fustrating when coding.<br>
  - Trying to add in a bounce or wraparound onto my characters, broke my characters a few time. It would move both my characters
    to the top of the y-axis and it wouldn't move from there.<br>
  - I also had a lot of problems with importing an image in, since I wanted a shapeship. When I tried to create a push & pop for
    the ship, it would constantly break my code or it wouldn't look like a spaceship at all.<br>
  
    <br>Sucesses: <br>
  - My push & pop characters came out really well. I'm proud of how they look and how I was able to add different features to them.<br>
  - I'm proud that I was able to figure out the KeyPressed wrapper for the space ship and was able to import the picture in correctly.
    It took me a while to figure it out and I'm proud that I stayed constant on working and trying to figure it out.<br>
  - The starry night backgrounds, is something I'm very proud off. I wanted to add stars to the background since it was shape, but I
    wasn't sure how to add them in. I give this credit to Chatgpt. Chatgpt helped give me an idea of what it can look like and I 
    used it to play around and create my background.<br>
