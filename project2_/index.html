<h1> Project 2 </h1>

<p> (<strong>Artist Sketch</strong>) My animation background.<br>

  <br>Functions Sucesses and Failures: <br>
- algorithms used: sine wave, particles, and parametric equations <br>
- sine wave: I used it to make a spiraling graph. I wanted it to be like my DNA branch at how it spiraled
  but it wasn't as sucessesful in the spiraling. It still came out good, but the framerate was a bit slow 
  when recording. <br>
- Particles: I wanted to use particles as a way to create an animation of web making from a spider. 
  However, every time I tried to change it or make it all connect to each other, it would only connect as
  small groups, not one big group. I found this rather fustrating and wasn't happy that when I did try to 
  group them in one group, the lines would disappear and the particles would be more visable. I had to 
  make do with the small groups and played with it a bit more to create more of a geometric shape for it,
  which looked quite cool in my opinion. <br>
- parametric equation: I did use this as a test to see what I wanted to do with it. I started with one 
  line spiraling without the others following behind. It looked really cool for a single string, but I 
  thought it would be better to see it in a group for a better visual. I added a few more other lines with 
  it and created this cool spiral, almost like a bunch of yarn all together. I really liked how that came 
  out and how I was able to use it. <br>
- struggles: Something I struggled a lot with in this project was the frame rate and putting in the 
  functions correctly. Many times I would put the functions incorrectly causing all my other acts to either
  fail or break because I either wrote it wrong or I was missing something. As for framerate, it was hard to
  judge how fast or how slow my acts should run.<br>
