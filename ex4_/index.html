<h1> Exercise 4 </h1>

<p> (<strong>Artist Sketch</strong>) More and more dogs. Who doesn't love to see dogs bouncing around the room?<br>

  <br>Functions: <br>
  - push & pop: For ltSpacePup and ltSpacePup2 <br>
  - parent & child: Added space helmets, color variety, backpacks, caps, and sunglasses <br>
  - bounce: ltSpacePup moves side to side on the screen looking like a superhero <br>
  - Class/array: used class as a way to put all my functions together so that it would be easier to idenitfy as well as an array
    to list everything out. <br>
  - framecut/count: to help randomize the pups and to create the exact amount of number of dogs into the picture  <br>
  - for loops: used them to test out my classes and arrays to make sure that they were working successfully in the frame  <br>
  - if statements: to test out my classes and make sure they are randomizied <br>

  <br> Struggles: <br>
  - Making classes and constructor, and making sure I wrote it correctly <br>
  - it was difficult for me to remember to write out "this.k" before the rest of the function. Becuase I forgot to write it like that
    it broke my function a lot of the times <br>
  - Found it fustrating making my functions work with the classes and displays. I wrote it wrong and sometimes it was hard to catch 
    that I wrote it wrong, especially when I changed the names <br>
  
    <br> Sucesses: <br>
  - My push & pop characters came out really well. I'm proud of how they look and how I was able to add different features to them. <br>
  - I'm proud that I was able to figure out how the successful count so that it counted the right amount of dogs. <br>
  - I'm proud that it uses both dogs not just one since I was having a lot of problems with that from the start. <br>
  - I'm very proud of my work and how it came out. I'm very surprised that I was able to do it and figure it out. <br>
