  <h1> Exercise 5.3 </h1>
  
  <p> (<strong>Artist Sketch</strong>) Sushi? Who doesn't love sushi! Check out my sushi pixel!<br>
  
    <br>Functions: <br>
    - Groups Theme: Asian Food <br>
    - made a 2 distinct 2d GridArray <br>
    - made a 16 by 16 GridArray <br>
    - the first 16 by 16 GridArray has 10 colors in total to show the image <br>
    - learned how to add more colors to the function  <br>
    - learned how to map colors to the Array to create an actual noticable pice  <br>
    - learned to to map more than one arrays together to build an image <br>
  
    <br> Struggles: <br>
    - it was hard to figure out how to add more colors to the array <br>
    - it was also hard to map the colors, because I would always be off by one or two when creating the image <br>
    - I found it hard to map different arrays around the canvas in a way to display the different changes to my arrays <br>
    - it was also hard for me to take my groups arrays and add them together to create different and unique maps <br>
    - trying to create a bitmap with multiple arrarys in it was definietly the hardest part of this assignment <br>
    - It was especially hard to create a different image with the different arrays that I have <br>
    
      <br> Sucesses: <br>
    - Proud that it was easy to create or form a 16 by 16 array with numbers<br>
    - Proud that after sometime I was able to figure out how to  <br>
    - I'm proud that it uses both dogs not just one since I was having a lot of problems with that from the start. <br>
    - I'm very proud of my work and how it came out. I'm very surprised that I was able to do it and figure it out. <br>
    - I found it fun to create different maps with the arrays to create something that was different maps with the arrarys<br>
        even though it was quite difficult to do <br>
    - I found it successful to work with my team to create these different arrays and to use their arrays to build different images <br>
