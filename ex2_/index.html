<h1> Exercise 2, Snap To Grid </h1>

<p>  In this sketch, I tried to use different external assets such as mouse events and properties, rectMode(), key events and properties, colorModes, boolean logic options, images, and fonts. Press a,w,s,d, and t to see the images. To toggle press 2, to change from black and a faded gray. </p>
<p>
    Here is my artist statement: <br>
    For this exercise, I found it a bit more challenging than the first project, especially since it was my first time coding such complicated functions. But first, for this project I started off with picking images for the projects. I decided to pick two different flowers, a pink peony and blue tulip. I decided to go with flowers because flowers are not only asethicially pleasing to look at, but because flowers have a lot of symbolizism behind them. However, for this project, I just picked them for the look and I wanted to use them for the keychoice function. The keychoice function was something that I found rather moderately easy for me to understand. At first it was a little difficult since I wasn't paying attention to all the function with the function name which caused my website to break down a few times, but once I made sure I changed all the function names to the correct names it made it a lot easier to put together. Another thing that I added was a font, which was slightly easy, but also hard. It was easy to put in the font and the function of what I wanted to say, but I was having trouble with downloading the font and putting it into the function. I was having a lot of problems with it and putting it in without breaking my keychoice function. After a few trials and error, I figured out that I should put the function for the font before my key choice function, which is what I did for the other functions. I also added a sketch to the exercise that would change the color of the circle from moving your mouse. This was also quite challenging because it kept breaking my function. I wasn't able to see my keychoice images and the only thing I was able to see was the text. I realized that the sketch's fade was too dark, making it hard for my images to be visible which is why I added a fade to help with the process of seeing my keychoice. Therefore making my experience with the project both challenging, but succesful because I was able to learn more about the codes and how to make them work successfully.
