<h1> Project 1 </h1>

<p> Here is my artist statement: <br> This project was a really fun, but challenging project I've ever done before. For this project, I couldn't decided what I wanted to do, whether that be mostly paint brushes or mostly stamps. However, I decided to stick with the stamps because I figured it would be really school to see transparent pictures as a way of creating art. For this assignment, I continue to stick with the flower team and made different artwork and pictures with them. I found the process of coding the pictures in was a lot easier than adding in the paint brushes. Everytime I tried to add the paint brushes and add over the codes, it would always break my code and the pictures would be no longer visible and it would show as an "error" on the console. I found this process to be really challenging because it took me about 10-15 tries until the function could successfully work. I noticed that whenever I put my functions in before it was sucessful, I was always missing another code or I forgot to define one of the function, making the function not work. Another thing that I found challenging but also fun was deciding what brushes and stamps I wanted to use. As required, I have 3 stamps, one peony, one daisy, and one tulip. Each flower is a different color, allowing it to be easier for others, as well as myself, to create pictures using the brushes and stamps. As for the brushes, I made 3 custom brushes all in the color of black. I had a black thin circle brush, a squared brush, and a triangle brush. I feel like during this project, I was mostly struggling with deciding on what I wanted to use and what order to put it in. However, overall the project was a lot of fun and I enjoyed being to able to test out my function. It was really cool to see the different works I was able to create with the different brushes and stamps I had.
