<h2> Exercise 1, Wild Wallpaper </h2>

<p> 
  This exercise was all about combining several  different examples togather.<br>
  I used many drawing functions such as ellipse(), rect(), triangle(), heart(), and a star(). I also used many console.log, loop control, if else control, basic color functions,operator shortcuts,mouseX and mouseY, width and height global properties.

    Here is my artist statement:
            For this exercise I found it quite successful and easy to understand drawing basic functions such as ellipse, rectangles, and triangles. As you can see from my function, I have many ellipse and rectangles that form a background for my wallpaper. From there, I added more of a rectangle grid in the background, laying it on top of the basic functions to really put my wallpaper together. I found this process of layering quite fun, since I had a fun time adding the basic color functions to it. For instance, for my exercise, I wanted to play around with pastle colors, but also trying to push myself out of my comfortzone. However, as easy as those were, it was also very challenging. Since this was my first time coding anything like this, it was very hard to pick up on on functions such as mouseX and mouseY or understanding how the console.log worked in a function. I was able to understand it,but for some reason it was still confusing to me on how it worked in the function even though I know what it was meant to do. Another think that I found challenging was adding two new shapes. I think the hardest shape for me to learn and understand was the star shape. Because the star shape has make points and vertices, it was harder to pick the correct points and sizing the star correctly.
